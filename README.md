Face livieness verification is an important part of the recognition process. It is mainly used to distinguish real faces from fake face images, and can identify spoofing behaviors using paper printing (Paper attack), screen remakes (replay attack) and 3D models(mask attack).


## Dataset



## Approach
For this project, I considered two filter:
 First filter : This filter help us recognize replay attack
 second filter: This filter help us recognize paper attack and 3D model (Using mask and 3D print)
